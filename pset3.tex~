\paragraph{Problem 1}

Any linear functional can be fully determined by its actions on a basis by
linearity:
\begin{displaymath}
  f\left(\sum_ka_ke_k\right) = \sum_k a_kf(e_k) \in \mathbb{R}
\end{displaymath}
thus any $f$ can be defined as a sequence $\{a_n\}$ where $f(e_k) = a_n$. If
$\{a_n\} \in \ell^1(\mathbb{N})$, for any $\{b_n\} \in c_0(\N)$, $|f_{a}
(\sum_kb_k)| = |\sum_ka_kb_k| \leq \max(b_n)\sum|a_k| \leq \infty$. Note that we
can take the max of $\{b_n\}$ because for any epsilon there are only finitely
many elements in the sequence greater than it. Hence $\ell^1(\N) \subseteq
c_0(\N)^*$.

Conversely, given some $\{a_n\}$ such that $\sum|a_n| = \infty$, we can find a
sequence of indices $n_1,\ n_2,\ldots$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^{n_k}|a_i| \geq
k^2$. Consider then the sequence $\{b_n\}$, with $b_i = |1/k|$ for $n_{k-1} <
i \leq n_k$, and the sign of $b_i$ the same as the sign of $a_i$. Then:
\begin{displaymath}
  f_a(\{b_n\}) \geq \sum_{i=1}^{n_k}a_ib_i \geq \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^{n_k}|a_i|
  \geq k^2/k \to \infty.
\end{displaymath}
Thus $f$ is unbounded and $\ell^1(\N) \supseteq c_0(\N)^*$.

\paragraph{Problem 2}

Part 1: Show isomorphism to standard basis. Then consider $f = 1,\ 1,\ 1,\ldots$,
this is norm 1, but finite sums of the $e_i$ will always yield $\|f- \sum e_i\|
= 1$.

\paragraph{Problem 3}

It is a subspace by the fact that if $a_n \to a$ and $b_n \to b$, $\lim a_n + b_n
$ exists, and is in fact $a + b$. Thus $\{a_n\} + \{b_n\} \in c$. Let $\{b_n\}$
be the limit of a sequence of sequences $\{a_n\}_k$. For any $\varepsilon > 0$,
there exists some $c_n = \{a_n\}_i$ such that $\sup|c_n - b_n| < \varepsilon/3$,
and also some $N$, because $\{c_n\}$ is convergent, such that $|a_m - a_n| <
\varepsilon/3$ for all $m,\ n > N$. Thus for any $m,\ n > N$,
\begin{displaymath}
  |b_n - b_m| \leq |b_n-c_n| + |b_m-c_m| + |c_n-c_m| < \varepsilon,
\end{displaymath}
i.e. $\{b_n\}$ is Cauchy and thus in $c$ as well. $c$ is therefore closed.

\paragraph{Problem 4}
No idea what a Borel measure is.

\paragraph{Problem 5}
Clearly $\ell(f) = f(x_0) \leq \sup(f) = \|f\|$ on $[0,1]$. Additionally, there are
clearly continuous functions that attain their maximum on $x_0$, thus the
inequality is sometimes an equality and $\|\ell\| = 1$.

\paragraph{Problem 6}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item 
  Let $f,\ g \in E_\alpha$. For all $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, $\lambda f(0) +
  (1-\lambda)g(0) = \lambda \alpha + (1-\lambda) \alpha = \alpha$, thus all
  convex combinations of $f$ and $g$ are clearly also in $E_\alpha$.

  Then, given
  any $f \in X$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists some continuous function
  $g \in X$ such that $\|f - g\| < \varepsilon/2$, (given the density of the
  continuous functions in $L^2$). Then we can find another function $h \in E_\alpha
  $such that $\|g-h\| < \varepsilon/2$, where $h = g$ in $[-1,1]\setminus [-\delta
  ,\delta]$, and $h$ decreases/increases linearly to $\alpha$ at $0$. We can find
  such a close $h$ because we can, by decreasing $\delta$, decrease the measure
  of the set on which $h$ differs from $g$ arbitrarily small, and this difference
  (squared) is bounded given the continuity of both functions and the compactness
  of our domain.
\item Express differences maybe?
  
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Problem 7}

Disjointness: a polynomial cannot both have a negative leading
coefficient and all non-negative coefficients, thus they are disjoint.
Convexity: the sum of two polynomials with negative leading coefficients has
a negative leading coefficient, this being either the sum of both or just one
of them; and the sum of two polynomials with non-negative coefficients has
non-negative coefficients as well. Finally, multiplying polynomials with
$0\leq \lambda \leq 1$ doesn't change the sign of its coefficients, thus both
$A$ and $B$ are convex.

Suppose there does exist some nonzero $\ell$ such that $\ell(a) \leq \ell(b)$,
for all $a$ in A and $b$ in $B$,
then by the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$, there exists a real $C$ (e.g. the
supremum of $\ell(a)$) such that $\ell(a)\leq C\leq \ell(b)$ for all $a$ and
$b$. Because $0 \in B$, by the linearity of $\ell$, $C \leq \ell(0) = 0$.
However, because for any monomial $a \in A$, $a/n \in A$ also, for $n>0$, thus
$\ell(a/n) = \ell(a)/n \to 0$ as $n\to\infty$. Thus $C \geq 0$, i.e. $C = 0$.

If $\ell$ is nonzero, there must be some monomial $x^n$ such that $\ell(x^n) 
\neq 0$,
as all polynomials are finite sums of monomials, and thus if they all mapped
to 0, $\ell$ would be 0 on all of $\mathcal{P}$. Clearly the sign of $\ell(ax^n
)$ is the same as the sign of $a$. Consider then the polynomial $p = -x^{n+1}
+ax^n$: because we can make $a$ and thus $\ell(ax^n)$
arbitrarily large, $\ell(-x^{n+1})$ cannot be finite and yet keep $\ell(p) = 
\ell(-x^{n+1}) + \ell(ax^n)$ to remain $\leq 0$ for all $a>0$ i.e. no such
linear functional can exist.
