\paragraph{Problem 1}
Right shift operator: firstly, for all $\l$, $R-\l I$ has a trivial kernel.
Proof: if $\l$ is zero, then it has a trivial kernel. For $\l \neq 0$, 
let $v$ be in the kernel of $R-\l I$. Then as $Rv = \l v$, and as $(Rv)_1 =
0$ by the nature of the right-shift operation, $v_1 = 0$. Additionally, if
$v_n = 0$, $(Rv)_{n+1} = \lambda v_n = 0$, and hence $v_{n+1} = 0$. By induction,
$v_n = 0$ for all $n$. This shows that there are no eigenvectors for any value
of $\l$, and thus $\s_p(R) = \O$, and it also means we've shown injectivity
for all values of $\l$ (for the subsequent spectra).

$s_c(R) \supset \{\l\in \mathbb{C}: |\l |=1\}$: first I show the range of $R-\l
I$ is dense. Consider some $v = \sum a_ie_i \in X$. Then let $w_n$ have the
first element $-a_i/\l$, then subsequent terms $-((w_n)_{k-1}-a_k)/\lambda$
until the $n$th element. $R-\l I$ applied to $w_n$ thus agrees with $v$ on the
first $n$ elements. Further:
\begin{displaymath}
  \|(R-\l I)w_n-v\|^2 \leq \sum_{k=n}^\infty\|a_k\|^2
\end{displaymath}
which goes to zero as $n\to \infty$ as $v$ is square summable, thus $(R-\l I)w_n
\to v$.


\paragraph{Problem 2}
I show no $\l$ can exist where $A = (T-\l I)$ has a trivial kernel and a
range that is not dense.

If $A$'s kernel is trivial, $\l \notin \{\l_i\}$, else $e_i$ is in the kernel of
$A$. In this case, note further that $A(e_i/(\l_i-\l)) = e_i$, so each $e_i$ is
in the range, and finite linear combinations of $e_i/(\l_i-\l)$ are members of
$\ell^2(\mathbb{N})$, thus because finite linear combinations of $e_i$ are dense,
the range is dense. Thus no lambda exists in $\sigma_r(T)$.

I now show $\lambda \in \overline{\{\l_i\}} \setminus \{\l_i\} \in \sigma_c(T)$.
Let $\l$ be a member of the set. Because $\l$ isn't an eigenvalue, by the same
argument as in the previous paragraph $A = T-\l I$ is injective and the range
is dense. To show that the range isn't closed, let $\l_n\to \l$, with $|\l_n-\l|
< 1/n^2$. Then let $v$ be the vector with $1/n$ in the component corresponding
to $\l_n$ in $T$ and 0 otherwise. The formal preimage of $v$ is the sequence with
$1/(n\l_n-n\l)$ in the positions corresponding to each $\l_n \in T$, but as
$|\l_n-\l| = 1/n^2$, the preimage of $v$ isn't in $\ell^2(\mathbb{N})$ as it
isn't square-summable. Thus $\l \in \sigma_c(T)$.

\paragraph{Problem 3}
All such operators map $\ell^2(\mathbb{N})$ to itself.
a) 0 is a compact operator, and $0 - 0I$ has a nontrivial kernel so 0 is in the
point spectrum. b) $T = T - 0I$ 
 mapping $e_i \to e_i/k$ has all coordinate vectors in its
range and thus has a dense range, but $(1,1/2,1/3,\ldots)$ has the formal
preimage $(1,1,1,\ldots)$, and thus the range isn't closed. It is compact
because it is the norm limit of finite rank operators sending $e_k\to e_k/k$
for $k < n$. c) $T = T- 0I$ sending $e_k \to e_{2k}/k$ is compact by the same
argument as the previous, has no kernel, but also has a range that isn't dense
as, for example, $e_1$ cannot be approximated by anything in its range.

\paragraph{Problem 4}
Let $\l \in \s_p(T)$ but $\notin \s_p(T^*)$, specifically, let $Tv = \l v$. Then
\begin{displaymath}
  T^*x^*(v) = x^*(Tv) = \lambda x^*(v).
\end{displaymath}
I now show that the range of $T-\l I$ cannot be dense. Let $v^*$ be the vector
of norm 1 such that $v^*(v) = \|v\|$, which is possible by Hahn-Banach. Suppose
the range is dense, and let $x_n^*$ be a sequence of vectors such that
$(T-\l I)x_n^*\to v^*$. Consider then
\begin{displaymath}
  (T-\l I)x_n^*(v) = Tx_n^*(v)-\l x_n^*(v) = \l x_n^*(v)-\l x_n^*(v) = 0,
\end{displaymath}
which means $x^*_n$ doesn't converge weak*ly to $v^*$, and hence also not in the
norm topology, a contradiction. Thus $\l \in \s_r(T^*)$.
